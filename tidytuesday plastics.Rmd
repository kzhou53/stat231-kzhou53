## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-01-26')

plastics <- tuesdata$plastics

# Or read in the data manually

plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')
```

```{r}
unique(plastics$country)
plastics_clean <- plastics %>%
  filter(country != "EMPTY", year == 2019, parent_company == "The Coca-Cola Company") %>%
  select(country, year, parent_company, grand_total)
```
